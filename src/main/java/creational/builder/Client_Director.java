/**
 * Director role of builder
 * <p>
 * In the builder pattern, we have four different roles, which are:
 * <p>
 * Product= We want to create objects of this class in our builder.
 * <p>
 * Builder/Concrete Builder= Defines methods to build parts of our final object, one part at a time
 * also provides method to build the final object, as well as an optional method that we can use to get
 * the final object of the object. - Can be implemented as an interface or abstract class, as well as inner class.
 * <p>
 * Director= Knows how to user the builder class, know the steps and sequence in order to build the final object.
 * It is rarely implemented as a separated class, usually the class who uses the builder plays the role of Director
 * <p>
 * The builder patter is used usually when there is an object with a complex constructor, or an object that is built
 * in multiple steps.
 * <p>
 * The StringBuilder can be used as an example of builder design pattern, however, it does not conform 100% with the
 * GOF definition.
 * <p>
 * A Great example of this pattern is the java.util.Calendar.Builder that provides methods that allows us to build
 * the Calendar.
 * <p>
 * A problem that may occur when using builder design pattern is that sometimes the build object may have some missing
 * properties, if required properties are missing, build method should provide suitable defaults, or throw exception.
